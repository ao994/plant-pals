## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We want the environment of our project to remain friendly and comfortable for 
all involved. As such, there may be no harassment of any kind (age, body, 
disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation) permitted in any project space or materials. Also, every member
of the team is expected to do their part and contribute appropriately to the 
project.

### Our Standards

Behaviors that are expected of participants include:

* Listening to suggestions from other team members
* Giving criticism kindly and constructively
* Being friendly towards other members of the team
* Supporting other team members when needed
* Completing work in a timely fashion
* Turning in work that is high quality

Behaviors that are unacceptable include:

* Insulting or being unkind toward other team members
* Producing work that has little time and effort put into it
* Being behind on work without communicating these difficulties to the team

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project meeting spaces, class, the discord,  
and within the materials made for this project. If circumstances outside of these 
arise, the group will discuss together to decide on the appropriate response.

### Enforcement

Any behavior that violates the code of conduct will be discussed
in the Monday meetings so that the team may decide on how best to move 
forward and find an understanding of the root of the issue. If the problem
needs to be addressed more immediately, it will be brought up in the 
'general' tab of the discord and a virtual meeting will be set up and held
to tackle the issue.
