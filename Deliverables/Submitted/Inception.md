# Project Inception
*Group 2 - "[Plant Pals]"
Group Members: Haley Berger, Haley Kloss, Alex King, Andrew Ortega, Karissa Smallwood

## 1) Introduction:
Welcome to Plant Pals, a hub for all things green!

Plant Pals is built to act as a resource for plant enthusiasts looking for information, a community, and a platform that ties both together. Hosting a searchable database for plants, Plant Pals aims to make it easier for plant lovers to get the information they need about how to care for their green friends. From general care to more specific details, Plant Pals aims to provide all the information a user could ask for. Plant Pals also hosts a community hub for enthusiasts to share their love of plants or to ask questions. Plant Pals also offers a specialized Plant Portfolio to the user on their profile page. Along with the private, digital display, Plant Pals offers the option for the user to fill out a table to keep track of their plant's weekly watering times. This is done to give the user an included space to keep track of their plants, look up information about plants, and talk to other like-minded individuals.

## 2) Initial value proposition and customer segments: 
i) Our services give a green thumb to even the most novice plant owners, and help even  accomplished gardeners grow! With Plant Pals, both a person who has just gotten their first cactus and someone who has long since turned their room into an indoor garden can find the community and information they need for themselves and their plants to thrive. On the Plant Pals website, you can find the need-to-know facts about your plants, or connect with other gardening enthusiasts about questions, ideas, or exciting updates. Many other plant websites have too much information and can be difficult to sort through, but Plant Pals provides only the necessary facts for success. Moreover, the addition of profiles and discussion boards provides the community that other sites lack. If you want to be a better plant parent, the Plant Pals are here to help!

ii) The intended consumer segment for this project is anyone who has a houseplant, from beginners to experts. Having all skill levels on the platform will allow dashboards to flourish, with learners to ask questions and those with experience to answer them. Furthermore, information about plants is not innate, and anyone with a new plant could utilize a concise database of plant information. 


## 3) Interviews summary: 

### **1. Jenna Sterry** 
Haley Kloss interviewed Jenna Sterry
#### When they were interviewed
2/2/24
#### Customer segment
Novice plant owner, freshman, female, STEM student.
#### Key insights from the interview
For a casual plant owner, the website would be useful but might not be visited frequently (Unless we added weekly features like watering reminders etc.). Overall, Jenna is not confident in identifying what might be wrong with her plant, and feels that she is moderately experienced. She has had a fair amount of plants in her life but many were accidentally killed by her cat or mother, and she mostly worries when her cat looks too closely at her plant or when its flowers don’t bloom. When she gets a new plant, Jenna likes to do a little bit of research so she knows about the water and sunlight requirements. Jenna also thinks that a community through discussion boards “would be smart.” She said that she has seen a lot of people go to unreliable places like Facebook to answer their questions. In terms of use for an app like ours, Jenna would use the app when she gets a new plant (about once a year she gets an orchid), and maybe if she was having issues with the plant. When browsing websites, she prefers using a free account over being anonymous, but she doesn’t like when they send junk mail. Jenna’s main struggles are with knowing what’s wrong with the plants or remembering to water them.
#### Representative quotes
About the importance of research when getting a plant: “You should know the basics” 
About why she keeps plants: “Yes they’re cool, they’re pretty, I like look at them”
Fun fact she learned about the best way to water hydrangeas: “It’s best to dunk hydrangeas in water” 
#### Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)
	Discussion board: Nice to have
	Searchable plant care database: Nice to have
	User accounts: Don’t care
	Plant portfolios for user accounts: Don’t care


### **2. Jolie Bushie**
Haley Kloss interviewed Jolie Bushie
#### When they were interviewed
2/2/24 
#### Customer segment
Inexperienced plant owner, Sophomore, female, only mildly interested in plants.
#### Key insights from the interview
Users who are not very interested in plants might use the app if they were confused or had an issue, but most likely only as an anonymous guest user. The website should support casual users who only hop on every once in a while. Also, some people are more interested in bouquets, and it might be beneficial to have a discussion board for vase flowers. Jolie has a little bit of experience with plants, but she is not confident in taking care of them and identifying issues. She has had plants and bouquets, such as vine plants, cacti, and a watermelon plant (a rabbit ate the watermelon plant, Jolie says "I’ll make rabbit stew next time i see him."). She tends to water them about once a week, and since the little plants don't need a lot of water so it’s usually fine. Even so, water is her main concern, though she doesn’t do much research; in general with plants, she usually just gets it, finds a good place for it, and tries to feel it out. She doesn’t usually use discussion based websites, but on Instagram a meme might get engagement. In closing, she says "I miss my watermelon plant."
#### Representative quotes
On when she makes accounts on websites: “Only if I know I will frequently go back to it.”
She also has a spam email account in case she signs up and it sends emails. 
On why she doesn’t often research plants: “Not exactly, ‘cus it’s not like I’m extensively taking care of them, and I usually just buy bouquets.”
#### Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)
	Discussion board: Don’t care
	Searchable plant care database: Nice to have 
	User accounts: Nice to have
	Plant portfolios for user accounts: Don’t care


### **3. Audra Nichlos**
Haley Berger interviewed Audra Nichlos
#### When they were interviewed
2/2/2024
#### Customer segment
Beginner plant owner, Sophomore, female, mild interest in plants.
#### Key insights from the interview
For someone whose plant ownership is much more akin to farming, most of the knowledge Audra used growing up was passed down to her. They didn’t tend to look things up and focussed much more on tradition. Now that she and her family no longer live on the land or take care of plants, she is unlikely to use the website. That said, when she was younger (and caring for the plants), she she said would have used the site to connect with like-minded people. She said that she liked the idea and that a discussion board on a website about only plants is bound to be much more reliable than an entirely open forum site. The people who go through the effort to make an account on a website that doesn’t have other distractions are making an account because they, generally speaking, actually want to.
#### Representative quotes
On if she would currently use a website that offered a discussion board to get help and/or talk about plants, a searchable plant care database, user accounts, and plant portfolios for user accounts: “When I was younger, yes, but not as much now that we don’t have an orchard.”
On if having information would be useful: “Not really, the information was passed down. We had an orchard, so that was what the information was geared towards.”
#### Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)
	Discussion board: Nice to have
	Searchable plant care database: Don’t care
	User accounts: Nice to have
	Plant portfolios for user accounts: Nice to have


### **4. Tirra Shawcroft**
Haley Kloss interviewed Tirra Shawcroft
#### When they were interviewed
2/2/24 
#### Customer segment
Inexperienced plant owner, interested in getting started.
#### Key insights from the interview
Tirra is interested in getting plants, but would appreciate it if a website were to create an easier point of entry. Their experience with plants is very minimal, especially since they don’t have a lot of time to get to know how to care for plants. When getting a new plant, Tirra often asks their roommate, who’s an environmental science major, what to do. They do have a plant but they often forget when they last watered it and the window sill in the dorm room isn’t big enough, so they don’t know where to put it or how much light it even needs. When something is wrong with their plant, Tirra panics because they don’t remember what the plant needs, but they know that it needs something. The idea of having discussion boards and a database to provide a concise way to learn about plants is something Tirra is interested in, and they think that the discussion board aspect is a really important part of building a  community; although they don’t post on such pages often, Tirra does often look at them for info.
#### Representative quotes
On feeling like they are bad at taking care of plants: “I killed a cactus… I have the opposite of a green thumb.”
About struggling to know what the plant needs:  “I don’t know anything about a lot of plants, and if I can barely take care of myself how would I take care of a plant?”
Tirra gets worried at browning or wilting of any kind, even though: “I know that sometimes it’s natural and has to happen, but I panic every time.”
About how often they might use this website: “I would use it a lot, I think it would be a lot easier for me to learn how to work with a plant if I had that”
On using websites as a guest vs. a user:  “I think it’s easier to be anonymous but if it’s free and nothing comes with it I will make an account.”
#### Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)
	Discussion board: Nice to have
	Searchable plant care database: Nice to have
	User accounts: Nice to have
	Plant portfolios for user accounts: Don’t Care


### **5. Faith Cook**
Haley Berger interviewed Faith Cook
#### When they were interviewed
2/3/24
#### Customer segment
Intermediate plant owner, female
#### Key insights from the interview
Faith loves plants, but has a really bad habit of over-watering them. She feels the internet can be very harsh to people with special interests, so having a dedicated space would be incredible because it could deter trolls. She also really likes the idea of being able to display images on a private user profile because it would make it a lot easier to show her friends. She wouldn't need to scroll through her gallery to look for the image because it would already be available on her private portfolio. Faith also said that a trusted database would be nice, especially if it's already just available on the same website as all the other plant stuff.
#### Representative quotes
When talking about the discussion board, “I LOVE my plants. I have a ton of pictures of them on my phone, so having a cute portfolio page would be amazing. If I am talking about them to someone, I can just pull up the website instead of searching through my photos.”
When talking about discussion boards in general, “I find that the internet can be very quick to judge people. They can just be so incredibly harsh. It's terrible. I think that if there is a page specifically dedicated to plants, there would be less trolls and people would actually be more open minded to helping people that are actually struggling. The plant community is dedicated, but I know that half the time I can't tell if it is just someone super inexperienced or a troll. With a dedicated page, people are less likely to spend time making a troll account that they can just use for multiple things.”
#### Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)
	Discussion board: Nice to have
	Searchable plant care database: Nice to have
	User accounts: Nice to have
	Plant portfolios for user accounts: Nice to have


### **6. Nathan Kaufman**
Alex King interviewed Nathan Kaufman
#### When they were interviewed
2/4/24 
#### Customer segment
Male
#### Key insights from the interview
Nathan is a forestry major who prefers experiencing plants outside, and has no interest in caring for plants now or in the foreseeable future. Therefore, Nathan does not fit the expected demographic of this project, which primarily targets people with a budding interest in plant care. 
#### Representative quotes
When asked if he was interested in caring for plants, Nathan responded with “no”.

### **7. Jordan Aragon**
Andrew Ortega interviewed Jordan Aragon
#### When they were interviewed
2/4/24 
#### Customer segment
Male
#### Key insights from the interview
Jordan likes to look at flowers anytime he visits Trader Joes, Target or any store that sells flowers.  He used to live in Hawaii so he likes flowers that have large pedals and vibrant colors.  He wants to be able to know how to take care of different plants because he wants to be able to have a garden when he owns his own house.  
#### Representative quotes
When asked about plants, Jordan responded “I love plants.  I have a tulip that has been blossoming recently.  I have pictures of it blossoming, do you want to see?”

### **8. Interviewee Name # 8**
Andrew Ortega interviewed Linda Ortega
#### When they were interviewed
2/5/24
#### Customer segment
Feamle, gardener
#### Key insights from the interview
Linda likes to garden in her free time and prune her rose bushes.  She also likes to visit different flower nurseries to see what plants she wants to plant in her yard. She would use the application as a main source of her information on how to keep a better record of her plants and what different care each require. 
#### Representative quotes
When asked about the care for plants, she listed that she needs, "help with propogation, what type of fertilizer is best for a plant, how to prevent the plant from being diseased, and how to tend to the insects that will be on the plant."
#### Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)
	Discussion board: Must have
	Searchable plant care database: Must have
	User accounts: Must have

### **9. Justin Wilbanks**
Alyssa Ortiz interviewed Justin Wilbanks
#### When they were interviewed
2/5/24
#### Customer segment
beginner, gardener, male
#### Key insights from the interview
Justin is an amateur gardener, who does not have extensive history with taking care of plants. He gardens mainly to produce fruits and vegetables to eat, and has trouble figuring out when to plant and when to harvest. He noted that he would heavily use the plant lookup database, and otherwise use the app once a week for other purposes. He would be interested in location-specific data for telling users which planting “zone” they are in, as he finds it difficult to find that information on his own.
#### Representative quotes
About favorite feature: “My favorite feature would definitely be the searchable database.”
When asked about what feature they would want the most: “I would want it to use location data that can give recommendations based on your zone.”
#### Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)
	Discussion board: nice to have
	Searchable plant care database: must have
	User accounts: nice to have
	Plant portfolios for user accounts: nice to have
  
### **10. Susan Broda**
Karissa Smallwood interviewed Susan Broda
#### When they were interviewed
2/7/24
#### Customer segment
female, has plants, very knowledgeable
#### Key insights from the interview
She said having an app at the beginning of your plant journey would be very useful. She also doesn't care for user accounts as well. Overall having an app that could possibly help when her plants are dying is very useful.
#### Representative quotes
“I love plants, they are very fun to have and take care of”
#### Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)
	Discussion board: Nice to have
	Searchable plant care database: Nice to have
